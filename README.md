CAT812 Node Guardian News Haiku
===============================

This was done as another early Nodejs test, in this case it grabs the latest story from the Guardian
and checks it for Haiku. I did a very bad job of porting some code to test for Haiku so instead it
throws them out to an external service.

Any matches it finds get thrown into the database for review.

The code never went any further than that, and a few weeks later someone published something similar
but using New York Times (or something) as the source so I abandoned this one.
